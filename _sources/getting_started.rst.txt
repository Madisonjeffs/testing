Getting Started
===================================
Base URL
--------
The base URL for the API is:

.. code-block:: text

   https://api.steampowered.com

Authentication
--------------
For some of the API methods, no authorization will be required. However for other methods with less publicly available data,
a unique API key may be required.
The methods that use customer sensitive data will require special access permissions and therefore require a publisher key.
The special publisher key will need to be created before calling such methods.

User Keys
-----------
Standard user keys are available to all, as long as a Steam account is held and the domain name associated with this key.

**The agreed terms of use for Steam Web API must be completed first** 

.. code-block:: text

   https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms


Publisher Keys
--------------
To create a publisher API key, administrative access must be held within an existing steamworks account. 

To create a publisher key:

* Using the account with administrative access , visit the group list. This is done via Users & Permissions -> Manage Groups.

* From the list of groups , select or create a group that contains APP ID's for which access is desired with the WebAPI key.

* Click into that group to view users and apps within the group.

* The option to create a web API key should appear on the right hand side , or will be listed if already created.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------
This quick start guide will walk you through making your first API call to retrieve player summaries.

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install the `requests` library using pip:

     .. code-block:: bash

        pip install requests

2. **Make Your First API Call**:
   - Use the following Python script to fetch player summaries:

     .. code-block:: python

        import requests

        # Your Steam Web API key
        api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

        # Steam IDs of players to fetch
        steam_ids = '76561198006409530,76561197960435530'

        # Endpoint URL
        url = f'https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUser/GetPlayerSummaries/v2?key={api_key}&steamids={steam_ids}'

        # Make the API request
        response = requests.get(url)

        # Check if the request was successful
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            print("Player Summaries:", data)
        else:
            print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

3. **Analyze the Response**:
   - The response from the API will contain the player summaries for the specified Steam IDs. Hereâ€™s an example of the JSON response:

     .. code-block:: json

        {
            "response": {
                "players": [
                    {
                        "steamid": "76561198006409530",
                        "personaname": "Player1",
                        "profileurl": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/player1/",
                        "avatar": "http://media.steampowered.com/steamcommunity/public/images/avatars/xx/xx.jpg"
                    },
                    {
                        "steamid": "76561197960435530",
                        "personaname": "Player2",
                        "profileurl": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/player2/",
                        "avatar": "http://media.steampowered.com/steamcommunity/public/images/avatars/yy/yy.jpg"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
